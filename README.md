Motivation Behind this Project:
I have been fascinated by sudoku puzzles ever since I was a child. My first interaction with the world of sudoku was when my mother
got a new Nokia phone which had a sudoku game pre-installed in it. I remember spending hours after hours trying to solve the first sudoku
puzzle with no progress. Frustrated, I stopped playing the game for a while. Years later, I came across another sudoku puzzle and after 
struggling with it at first, I started to understand the tricks, logic, and mathematical beauty of sudoku puzzles. This project is a 
demonstration of my affinity towards sudoku puzzles and algorithmic thinking.

Tools and Technologies used:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- JQuery Libraries
- Google Charts Packages

Objectives of this Project:
- To create an interactive, user-friendly, single-page application.
- To allow users to solve sudoku puzzles of any level of difficulty using 5 different models.
- To ensure that the algorithms are correctly implemented and are as space and time efficient as possible.
- To graphically analyze and compare the preformance of the different algorithms for the given sudoku puzzle.

Components of this Projects:
Static Viewable Content_
- index.htm : The page that the user views on the browser
- styles.css : Responsible for making the HTML elements visually appealing
- background.png, sidebackground.jpg, sudokulogo.jpg : Viewable images
Interactive User Interface_
- userInterface.js : Provides user interactivity and relevant functionality
- sudokuSize.js : Dynamically sets sudoku size based on user's choice
- sudokuSet.js : Resests sudoku table or sets the solved sudoku table
- sudokuEvaluate.js : Responsible for extracting user input, validating it, and invoking algorithm solving functions or displaying 
  relevant messsages.
Algorithm Implementaion_
- bruteForce.js : Implementation of brute force algorithm
- backTracking.js : Implementation of back tracking algorithm
- crook.js : Implementation of crook's algorithm
- nakedSingle.js : Implementaion of naked single's algorithm
- loneRanger.js : Implementation of lone ranger's algorithm
- validElement.js : Evaulates whether the current value abides by sudoku's constraints
- global.js : Important global entities
Graph Implementaion_
- graph.js : Implements and manipulates individual graphs, bar charts, and the left sidebar
